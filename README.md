# scroll

Scroll is a little dungeon crawler in the browser, and still very
much a work in progress.

## Development
I've used [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for bundling,
so watching with live reloading can be done via:

```bash
parcel src/index.html
```

and building can be done via

```bash
parcel build src/index.html
```

### Credits

I've shamelessly taken the art from [quale](Quale-Art.Blogspot.com), specifically,
